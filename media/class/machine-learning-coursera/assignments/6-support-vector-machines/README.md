# Support Vector Machines

Matlab-notebook for this chapter is in [here](https://1drv.ms/w/s!AllPqyV9kKUrj2U13U88HZpbbBDv).

## Summary
* using support vector machines (SVMs) to build a spam clasisfier
* see how the outlier affects the SVM decision boundary whenever the C parameter varies
* using SVM with gaussian kernel, decision boundary is learnable to separate non-linear dataset
* with optimized parameter set C and sigma, see how SVMs are working
* using SVMs, build spam classifier
   * text pre-processing to normalize
   * binary feature representation with vocabulary
   * inspect learned parameters, to see which words are most predictive of spam
