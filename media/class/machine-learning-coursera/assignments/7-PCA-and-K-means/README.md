# Principal Component Analysis and K-Means Clustering

Matlab-notebook is in [here](https://1drv.ms/w/s!AllPqyV9kKUrj2hWHCEfERwBVfP7).

## Summary

* implement K-means clustering algorithm and apply it to compress an image
   * 2D dataset to get intuition on how K-means works
   * image compression by reducing the number of (most common) colors
* use principal component analysis to find a low-dimensional representation of face images
   * 2D datasert to get intuition on how PCA works
   * run PCA on face images for dimension reduction
