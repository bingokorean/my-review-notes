# Anomaly Detection and Recommender Systems

Matlab-notebook is in [here](https://1drv.ms/w/s!AllPqyV9kKUrkFFhy_tUeYt9ZiqK).

## Summary
* Anomaly detection algorithm to detect anomalous behavior in server computers, using Gaussian distribution
* Select the threshold of anomaly algorithm, using labeled dataset, cross validation and F1 score
* Collaborative filtering algorithm, using gradient descent with regularization
* Collaborative filtering can predict unseen movie ratings for each user and then recommend to user
