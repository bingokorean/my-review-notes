# Multi-class Classification and Neural Networks

The report where program results are is in [**here**](https://1drv.ms/w/s!AllPqyV9kKUrhFFmDyBqz8kDBPic)

## Summary
* Implement one-vs-all logistic regression and use pretrained neural network for recognizing hand-written digits (10-class) 
* For one-vs-all, we need to train 10 separate logistic regression classifiers, but when training they are simultaneously done (via *fmincg*).
* One-vs-all = Kind of neural network
