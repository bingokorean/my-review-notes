# Regularized Linear Regression and Bias v.s.Variance

Matlab-notebook is in [**here**](https://1drv.ms/w/s!AllPqyV9kKUrhGDkzE1z7koyqZii)

## Summary
* Study regularized linear regression models with different bias-variance properties
* Debugging learning algorithms (1): Plot the fitted line and data (2): Plot learning curves
* **Learning curves** with train/validation errors
   * check the high bias and variance (with various size of training data)
   * find best model parameter
