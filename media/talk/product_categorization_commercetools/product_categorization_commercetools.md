In this talk, Amadeus Magrabi presents the approach at commercetools to automate this process by using methods from machine learning and artificial intelligence.

Product categories are the structural backbone of every online shop. To attract customers and facilitate navigation, categories need to be easily understandable, logical and consistent. With the explosive growth of data, it is becoming more and more difficult for retailers to match products to appropriate categories, and large product catalogs as well as the need to quickly adapt to changes often lead to costly misclassifications

## Review

* Product Categorization을 위한 기본적인 기계학습 모델을 볼 수 있음.
* pharsing이라는 전처리를 알게 됨. (한국어에서는: 복합명사의 경우는 phrasing할 때 주의해야 하지만, 고유명사는 phrasing이 하는 게 좋을 것 같음)
* 그 이외는 기본적인 내용임.
