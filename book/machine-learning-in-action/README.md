_Part 1. CLASSIFICATION_
  * Machine learning basics
  * Classifying with k-Nearest Neighbors
  * Splitting datasets one feature at a time: decision tree
  * Classifying with probability theory: naive Bayes
  * Logistic regression
  * [Support vector machines](https://github.com/gritmind/review-paper/blob/master/book/machine-learning-in-action/review/6_support-vector-machines.md)
  * Improving classification with the AdaBoost meta-algorithm

_Part 2. FORECASTING NUMERIC VALUES WITH REGRESSION_
  * Predicting numeric values: regression
  * Tree-based regression
  
_Part 3. UNSUPERVISED LEARNING_
  * Grouping unlabeled items using k-means clustering
  * Association analysis with the Apriori algorithm
  * Efficiently finding frequent itemsets with FP-growth

_Part 4. ADDITIONAL TOOLS_
  * Using principal component analysis to simplify data
  * Simplifying data with the singular value decomposition
  * Big data and MapReduce
