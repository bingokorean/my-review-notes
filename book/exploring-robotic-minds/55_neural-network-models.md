## Summary
There are three types of basic neural network models including the tree-layered feed-forward network, the discrete-time RNN, and the continuous-time RNN (CTRNN). All has two distinct modes of operation. One is the learning mode to find the optimal weight set from a training dataset, and the other is the testing mode where an optimal output pattern is generated from an test input pattern.
