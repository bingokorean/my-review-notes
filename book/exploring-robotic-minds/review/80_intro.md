## Summary
In real physical world, everything changes continuously in time. Discontinuous flow is rare. Moreover, Sensory-motor states change continuously and neural activation states in essential dimensions also do (Churchland 2010). 

If this is granted, one of most difficult questions should be `how continuous Sensory-motor flows can be recognized (=segmented into chunks) and generated (with articulation) structurally`.

There are some theories to explain this question:
* Motor schemata theory (Michael Arbib (1981)): a set of well-practiced motor programs or **primitives** are stored in long-term memory, and different **combinations** of these programs in space and time can generate a variety of motor actions. Actions can be generated by concatenating different chunks or behavioral schemes. 
* (Kuniyoshi, 1994): complex human actions can be recognized by their structually **segmenting** visual perceptual flow of concatenated reusable patterns.
* (Kuniyoshi, 2004): in a psychological experiment, recognition of timing of such **segmentation** is essential to extract crucial information about the action observed.

The problem of segmentation is closely related to the phenomenological problem of time perception considered by `Husserl` (Chapter 3.2와 연결)(-> How a flow of experiences in the preempirical level can e consciously recalled in the form of articulated objects or events at the objective time level) 

In this chapter, our robots have to deal with a continuous flow of Sensory-motor experiences. In detail:
  * How our robots can acquire a set of behavioral schemes
  * How our robots can be used for recognizing as well as generating whole complex actions by segmenting or articulating the Sensory-motor flow

The author presume that **mirror nuerons** are integral to such processes because they can encode basic behavior schemes in terms of predictive coding that can be used for both recognition and generation of Sensory-motor patterns (Chapter 4.2와 연결). This chapter develops this idea into a synthetic neurorobotics model. 

The following sections will introduce our formulation of the basic dynamic neural network model for the **mirro neuron system**. The formulation is followed by *neurorobotics experiments* utilizing the model for a set of *behavior patterns*, *imitative learning*, and acquisition of actional concepts via *associative learning* between a quasilanguage and motor behaviors.

The analysis of these experiments results provide us with some insight into:
   * How the interaction between to top-down prediction/generation process and the bottom-up recognition process can achieve segmentation of a continuous perceptual flow into meaningful chunks
   * How **distributed representation** schemes adopted in the model can enhance the generalization of learned behavioral skills, knolwedge, and concepts
