## Summary
Phenomenology originated with Edmund Husserl's study called **phenomenological reduction**, through which `the analysis of the natural world is based purely on the conscious experiences of individuals`. 

This chapter shows:
  * **phenomenological reduction** (Husserl's study)
  * Extension of Husserl's 
    * **existentialism** by Martin Heidegger
    * **embodiment** by Maurice Merleau-Ponty
  * philosophical ideas about the mind which are quite analogous to Husserl's (by William James)
  * ideas with some affinity to those of Husserl and James (by Kitaro Nishida)

Phenomenology give us some questions: (by using our assumption that the world exists as a physical fact from the outset)
  * How the world can exist for us
  * How such a belief can be constituted from our experiences

In Cognitive science...
  * How the world can be constituted in our subjective reflection
  * How the knowledge of the world can be represented

Phenomenology more focus on phenomena themselves, through `direct perception or pure experience, which has not yet been ariticulated either by conception or language`. 개개인의 주관(subjective reflection)을 최대한 배제한 채, 사물을 있는 그 자체(phenomena)로 바라보겠다라는 철학이 있다. 그리고 세상을 최대한 그 모습/그 자체로(pure experience) 해석하겠다라는 뜻이 있다. For example, a rose exists in our subjectivity as a conscious phenomenon of a particular smell or a particular visual shape, but not by our knowledge of its objective existence.

However, Phenomenology also deal with the being of cogito (how cognition arises) in the higher level by examining `how it can be developed purely through the accumulation of perceptual experiences`. Therefore, phenomenology asks how cognition is constituted from direct perception. (그래도, 개인적인 주관(being of cogito)을 완전히 배재할 수는 없다. 개인적인 주관이 어떻게 direct perception과 상호작용하는지 살펴볼 필요가 있다.) Later, it is related to how robotic agents can develop views or recognition of the world from their own sensory-motor experiences. (로봇은 사람과 달리 개인적인 주관의 힘이 약하기 때문에 phenomenology 측면을 잘 활용할 필요가 있다.)
