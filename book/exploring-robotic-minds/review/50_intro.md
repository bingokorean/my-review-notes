## Summary
_[Simple Reasoning Play from Nobelist]_
* *"What I cannot create, I cannot understand." -Richard Feynman, who is Nobel laureate in physics*
* Conversely, *"I can understand what I can create."* and then "If I can create something, I can understand it
* In our problem perspecitive, if we can synthesize something, we should know its **organizing principles**. By this reasoning, we might be able to understand the cognitive mind by synthesizing it.

_[How can we synthesize the mind?]_
* First, building the brain models ("Hey, I build it!") **VERY DIFFICULT STEP!**
  * Although we don't yet know exactly brain's organizing principles, we can begin through a survey of results from neuroscience, psycholoy and cognitive science. 
* Second, examining the robot behave while interacting with the environment or how the neural activation state changes dynamically in the aritifial brains while interacting ("OK~ Let me see...")
  * we can examine neural activation dynamics of a brian model and behaviors of such embrained robots via robotics experiments

_[Our brain model principle]_
* All interactions occur within the model brains, as well as between them and the environment by **circular causality**
* All interactions are dominated by **nonlinear dynamics** for which numerical solutions cannot be obtained analytically

_[How to analyze our brain model?]_
* Since our model is difficult to be analyzed, we can analyze it by using **some evidences** from robotics experiments.
* We should expect such robotics experiments might evidence **nontrivial phenomena** that are not to be inferred from formative principles.
* We can think that the presumed principles behind the models would seem to hold if such emergent phenomena observed in experiments correspond to various bodies of work including empirical observations in neuroscience, cognitive science (computational aspects), phnomenological reduction.

_[Goal of the synthetic approach of our brain model]_
* It would be great if just a small set of principles in the model could account for numerous phenomena of the mind through their synthesis. 

_[Embodied Mind/Cognition]_
* Embodied Mind: the mind is a product of emergent processes appearing in the structural interactions between the brain and the environment
* Many phenomena emergent from embodied cognition can be efficiently described in the language of dynamical systems.
* The idea if embodied cognition is described by psychological studies focusing on embodiment and "new-trend" artificial intelligence robotics studies (-> behavior-based robotics involving the synthesis of embodied cognition)
* Psychological views (such as Gibsonian and Neo-Gibsonian approaches) have been well incorporated into dynamical system theories (why?), and have thus provided useful insights guiding behavior-based robots and neurorobots.
