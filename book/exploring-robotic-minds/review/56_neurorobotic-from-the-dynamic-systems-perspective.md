# 5.6. Neurorobotic from the Dynamic Systems Perspective

## Keyword


## Summary
### 0. Intro
We will see the issues of embodiment emphasized on the behavior-based approach. A representative researcher in this field, Randall Beer (2000), proposed the idea of considering the **structural coupling** between the neural system, the body, and the environment. The internal neural system interacts with its body. The body interacts with its surrounding environment. So, the three can be viewed as a **coupled dynamical system**. 

`The objective of neural adaptation is to keep the behavior of the whole system within a viable zone`. Obviously, this thought is quite analogous to the **Gibsonian** and **Neo-Gibsonian approaches**. 

In the 1990s, various experiments were conducted in which different neural adaptation schemes were applied in the development of sensory-motor coordination skills in robots. These schemes included:
  * Evolutional learning, which uses artificial evolution of genomes encoding connection weights for neural networks based on principles such as survival of the fittest.
  * Value-based reinforcement learning, wherein the connection weights are modified in the direction of reward maximization
  * Supervised learning and Imitation learning, wherein a teacher or imitation targets exist

Most experiments were conducted in **minimal settings** with rather simple robots with small-scale neural controllers influenced by Gibsonian and behavior-based philosophy. Although there has lacked scalability both with respect to engineering applications and accounting for human cognitive competence, they demonstrate that nontrivial structures in terms of **minimal cognition or minimal cognitive behavior** can emerge in the **structural coupling** between simple neural network models and the environment. 


### 1. Evolution of Locomotion with Limit Cycle Attractors
Rhythmical movements such as Locomotion are generated by **neural circuits** called **central pattern generators (CPGs)**, which generates oscillatory signals by means of **limit-cycle dynamics** in neural circuits (Delcomyn, 1980). 여기서 signal를 dynamics라고 생각해도 되고, 좋은 signal은 attractor dynamics라고 생각해볼 수 있다. Movement에 필요한 limit-cycle dynamics는 (학습된) neural circuits에서 생성된다.  


### 2. Developing sensory-Motor Coordination

### 3. Self-Organization of Internal Contextual Dynamic
The role of neuronal system should not be regarded as a simple mapping from sensory inputs to motor outputs.
