## Summary
* The goal of this book is to construct the minds of robots
* The proposal is that the mind is comprised of **emergent phenomena**, which appear via intricate and conflictive interactions between the **top-down subjective view** for proactively acting on the external world and the **bottom-up recognition** of the resultant perceptual reality.
* This proprosal can provide a nice frame to account for the various fundamental aspects of the cognition/mind
* Allowing entangling interactions between the top-down and bottom-up processes means that the skills (we need to generate complex actions, knowledge) and concepts (we need to express our experiences) can naturally develop
* The **cogito** (that allows this "compositional" yet fluid thinking and action) appears to be embedded in **dynamic neural structures**
* The cogito is (Descartes Saying) "I think, therefore I am.", denotes a **subject of cognizing or thinking**
* The cogito can avoid the problems ingerent in **Cartesian dualism** (Descartes concept of dualism) such as that of interaction and how a nonmaterial mind can cause anything in a material body and world and vice versa
* The reason why to avoid such problem is because the cogito embedded in the continuous state space of dynamic neural systems is also **matter**, rather than nonmatter composed of a discrete symbol system or logic
* So, the cogito can interact **physically** with the external world, thereby finding a point of compromise in conflictive situations through iterative dynamics
* By considering consciousness as the emergent phenomenon of matter, we can deal with it through such conflictive interactions
* The matter is alive and vivid in never-ending trials by the cogito to comprehen an ever-changing reality in an open-ended world
* The book aims for a unique way of understanding the mind from rather an unordinary but inspiring **combination of ingredients** such as humanoid robots, Heidegger's philosophy, deep learning neural nets, strange attractor from chaos theory, mirror neurons, Gibsonian psychology, and more
* Before exploring the **subjects** spefically in relation to the emergent phenomena which the author believe constitute the mind, each of the chapters start by presenting general concepts or tutorials on each discipline (cognitive science, phenomenology, neuroscience and brain science, nonlinear dynamics, and neural network modeling)


## Summary with My View
How to construct the minds of robots, which are nonmaterial things? We need to make a nice frame to account for the various fundamental aspects of the cognition/mind (such as humanoid robots, Heidegger's philosophy, deep learning neural net, etc) because it is not simple one. In order to represent the minds we borrow some ideas from Descartes saying "I think, therefore I am." (called cogito), meaning that there is an interaction between material and nonmaterial things. Given this idea, we can avoid the problem of Cartesian dualism like how a nonmaterial mind can cause anything in a material body and vice versa. Of course, we can think of Descartes saying as the cognition/mind, which can interact with the external world (ex. the body). 

Then, how to build the cogito? The author suppose that it is comprised of emergent phenomena or matter in the open-ended world (not nonmatter in the closed-ended world), which appear via conflictive interactions betweenÂ the top-down subjective view and the bottom-up recognition. Also, the cogito appears to be embedded in dynamic neural structures where we can find a point of compromise in conflictive situations through iterative dynamics. And we can think of the point as the core of robot mind.
