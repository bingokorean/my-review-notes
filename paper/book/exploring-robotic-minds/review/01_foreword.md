# Foreword
This chapter as foreword represents what is the book talking about in big picture. Frank E. Ritter who is editor of this series tell us something like guideline including the contents and motivations of the author's works in high-level. The reason why this short chapter is important is because it could lead for beginners to easily understand this topic.     Â 

## Review
The world (i.e nature, space, human) consists of many kinds of both material and nonmaterial things. If we want to model them in human language (ex. english, math, python,..), we must clearly understand them. Surely, it could be even harder to design nonmaterial (ex. human cognition/mind) than material (ex. leg bone) because we don't know exactly what it looks like and it could vary according to some aspects and it could be effected by the environment every moment. Even though it would be hard or impossible, we can approximately design those things by using assumption and our own way. 

We have an assumption like **physical symbol hypothesis**, meaning that the world could be defined as symbol. Also, we are interested in not all parts of embodied cognitions, but some parts such as how to interact with environment well and how to make complex behaviors using simple aspects. Therefore, we can model such things as **symbol representation**. Among many ways for symbol representation, the author proposed **'composable neuro-dynamic structure'** or 'dynamic behavior of systems', whose philosophy is to **understand through generation of behavior**. It is not just simple discrete symbol representation designed by data structures in traditional way. In order to design well, we need to have good insights of understanding interaction between mind and environment, consiousness (attractor), free will and understanding neural networks. 

The virtue of neuro-dynamic structure (wherein knolwledge, feedback, attractors) is as hierarchical and mental representations , it could avoid the symbol grounding problem or the mind-body problem.

## Summary
* This book is useful for modelers who want to use 'symbolic', 'subsymbolic', and 'hybrid architectures'
* The content is based on Newell and Simon's (1975) theory of empirical exploration of computer science topics (understanding through generation of behavior)
* The author want to illustrate physical symbol hypothesis that the symbols of human cognition can be **composable neuro-dynamic structures**, not just discrete symbols.
* The author is interested about **embodied cognition**. For example...
  * how interaction with the environment happens
  * what the interaction means for representation and learning
  * how more complex behavior can be created
  * how that complex thing arises through more simple aspects
* In order to model embodied cognition, we need insights. For example...
  * the role of interaction with the environment
  * consciousness
  * free will
  * how to build neural net architectures
* The contents of this book:
  * philosophical foundations (ex. symbol grounding problem, phenomenology, role of time in thinking, ..)
  * the role of **hierarchy** in modeling cognition
  * modeling and understanding interaction with an external world
  * **state space attractors** 
    * it is a useful concept in understanding cognition
    * it could be a useful additional way to measure fit of a model to behavior
* The author argue that behaviour is not always programmed in a system, but can should arise by attempting to achieve **homeostasis**
* Homeostasis means there are positions of stability in a mental representation
* Differences in knowledge between the levels can give rise to effects such as:
  * a type of consciousness
  * a mental trace of what lower levels should do 
  * explanations of what they have done based on predictions of the agent's own behavior
  * a type of self-reflexive mental model
* More model should model homeostasis and include more goals and knowledge about how to achieve it
* The author use **dynamic behavior of systems** for representing and generating behavior, rather than the data structures used in more traditional approaches
* Dynamic behavior of systems (wherein knolwledge, feedback, attractors) give us insights about how compositional thoughts and actions can be generated without facing the notorious problems of the symbol grounding problem or the mind-body problem
* Dynmaic behavior of systems consist of layers of representation.
* In layers of representation, higher levels might not just lead the lower levels, but also **follow or predict them**, adjusting their own settings based on the lower level's behavior
* 'Follow or predict them' means from it we can get a potential computational description, explanation of some forms of consciousness and free will
* The mismatch (from 'follow or predict them' process) could lead to a kind of postdiction in which intention becomes consciously aware after action
